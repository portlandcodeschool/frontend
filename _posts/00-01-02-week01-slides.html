  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Extrinsic</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Intrinsic</h1>
    <ul>

      <li>Often comes from the work itself</li>
      <li>Very, very powerful</li>
      <li>Most powerful:
        <ul>

    <h2>Why does this matter?</h1>
    <h3>You are entering a profession where:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>You must learn relentlessly just to stay in the game</li>
      <li>Nobody can schedule worth beans, so you are always working late to meet a deadline</li>
      <li>Inteviewing for jobs and bidding on contracts is brutal on the ego</li>
      <li>There's lots of sexism, elitism, and other bullsh*t that has nothing to do with how good you are</i></li>
    </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><i>Illegitimi non carborundum</i></p>
