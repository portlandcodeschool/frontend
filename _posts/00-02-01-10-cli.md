The coder's basic medium is **text**. Her basic tools are **shell** and a **text editor**

## Command line

At the bottom of every computer is the Command Line Interface (CLI), implemented with a program called a *shell*. It is the most basic user interface.

Patterns and expectations for interacting with CLI: very few! *Affordance* is what a machine invites you to do with it. CLI's have very few affordances, so you have to memories the command format and use the built-in help.

Every command is an abbreviation and takes options and arguments.

To find help about unix commands:
**man [command]** will give you the help for a command

Example:

```
man ls
```

Here are some common unix commands


| ```pwd```   | | Print working directory |
| ```cd```    | | Change directory |
| ```ls```    | | List directory contents |
| ```ls -alF``` | | Show all files in the long form and mark the folders |
| ```touch``` | | Create a file or update it's modified date |
| ```rm```    | | Remove a file |
| ```rm -r``` | | Remove a directory and *everything it contains*. |
| ```mkdir``` | | Make directory |

Here are some short names for folders:

| Name | Convention | Description |
|:-----:|:----:|:--------|
| .  | "dot" | current working directory
| .. | "dot dot" | parent of the current directory
| /  | "root" | top of the directory tree
| ~  | "home" | currently logged-in user's home directory

*Paths* are a series of directory names, separated by  **/**, the "path separator" character. On *nix machines (and gitbash), this is '/', on Windows, it's '\'.  A path specifies the location of a directory or file in the driectory tree. They can either be 

* **absolute** - starting with the root of the tree. Example (Notice the leading "/" character):

~~~~
    /Users/zim/Dropbox/pcs/frontend/index.html
~~~~

* **relative** - starting with the current working directory. Example: if the current directory is ```/Users/zim/Dropbox```, then the path to the same file is (Notice that there is *NO* leading "/" character):

~~~~
    pcs/frontend/index.html
~~~~
