The second week of class is an introduction to tools and technologies. For some students, it's mostly refresher, so we'll be teaching each other.


 We'll cover:

- working with text using the shell
- characteristics of text editors
- Basic HTML structure, tables, & forms
- Basic CSS rules and selectors
- Single developer Git workflow



# Notes

## Text
The coder's basic medium is **text**. Her basic tools are **shell** and a **text editor**

## Command line

At the bottom of every computer is the Command Line Interface (CLI). It is the most basic user interface.

Patterns and expectations for interacting with CLI: very few! *Affordance* is what a machine invites you to do with it. CLI's have very few affordances, so you have to memories the command format and use the built-in help.

Every command is an abbreviation and takes options and arguments.

To find help about unix commands:
**man [command]** will give you the help for a command

Example:

```
man ls
```

Here are some common unix commands
**~/**    Home directory
**pwd**   Print working directory
**cd**    Change directory
**/**     Path separator
**ls**    List directory contents
**rm**    Remove a file
**mkdir** Make directory

**ls -alF**  show all files in the long form and the folders


There are a lot of helpful unix cheat sheets and here is one:
