The first week of class is mostly getting to know each other and understanding where the class is going to go for the next 16 weeks. We'll cover:

- Getting to know each other
- HTML, CSS, & JavaScript basics
- Learning techniques
- Teamwork
- Community

We'll have some assignments that you must do this week:

- Lightning talk about something you already know
- Attend some community event and report back
- Your first whiteboarding session to see what you already know

And, you'll have homework to prepare for next week:

- Treehouse video screencasts
- CodeAcademy interactive exercises
- Reading assignments


# Getting to know each other

We'll literally start out in the woods for some teamwork and ice-breaking activities, then return to the classroom.

In the classroom, we'll meet each other and get to understand a little bit about everybody's background, motivation, and goals. Each class session is customized for each cohort and this understanding makes sure the class is productive for everybody. We'll also discover how much knowledge and experience all of us bring to the class and what we can learn from each other.

Each student will be asked to identify a web development goal, which can take the many forms:
- a web site they'd like to build someday
- a web site they like that they want to imitate
- a problem that people have that they'd like to help solve

# HTML, CSS, & JavaScript basics

We'll take some time to see where everybody is at in the first three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then we'll assign homework accordingly. 

You'll be doing about 10 hours of screencasts and interactive exercises at home this week. Which ones will depend on what you already know.

*Whiteboarding* isn't a form of torture, it's a way for you to show an interviewer what you know. It's an essential interviewing technique and we'll be practicing it all term. We'll start with some evaluation whiteboarding to see how much you already know so we don't have to waste your time.


# Learning about learning

We'll spend some time discussing and playing with learning itself. This will include:

- Finding your personal motivation to work harder than ever before
- Best practices in taking notes
- Identifying and cataloging important vocabulary terms
- Identifying patterns that repeat from language to language and from technology to technology
- Effective studying, working, and mentoring techniques
- "Computational thinking" -- how to start thinking about solutions to problems in ways that can be coded into computer software


## Motivation
We will do an exercise in class to help you understand why you are motivated to learn. We will discuss the difference between *intrinsic* and *extrinsic* motivation and then identify the key factors in your life that will give you the energy to work hard and to attain your goals in the web developer profession.

# Teamwork warm-ups

In addition to working alone, students are required to work effectively in teams and in pairs. This isn't just a good idea -- employers require it. This can often be more difficult than the technical aspect of assignments, but it's an essential skill set.

We'll start by literally playing games as teams and as pairs to limber up our cooperation muscles.

# First weekly lightning talk

An essential part of learning is teaching. Students will be required to present to the class every week. We'll start with familiar stuff, then we'll help each other explore new topics. As we create web sites, we'll do client demos and code walkthroughs.

This first week, you'll need to stand up and present for 5 minutes, without notes or overhead slides, something you already know about and enjoy, in any topic area.


# Community building

Students are required to seek out, attend, and report back on community events every week. We'll check Calagator, Meetup, and other resources to identify interesting meetups, networking opportunities, and simple coffee shop collaboration events. Students will be required to report to the class three things:

1. Where they went (what organization or sponsor)
2. One thing they learned that might be useful
3. One person they met and something about them, like what they do, why they were there, what they think about something.

The point is to start building your personal network by making friends.

# Tools

Finally, we'll have an install fest to make sure everybody has the basic tools installed. See the syllabus for the complete list.
