## Git

####Git Set Up:
Set up an account on
[Github](http://www.github.com)

Do the refresher at 
[Try Git](https://try.github.io/)

Read the book at
[Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book)


#####Git Basic Vocabulary Words:
* git - a version control tool
* github - a collaboration website
* repository - All the changes to set of files and folders
* markdown - a set of symbols ("markup") to specify formatting
* clone - make a local copy of a repository
* init - change a directory tree into a repository
* add - move a file to the staging area
* commit - store the contents of the staging area to the repository
* pull - bring other people's changes to local repo
* push - share changes


#####Git Basic Local Workflow:
0. Initialize folder to be a repository
0. Make modifications to files and folders
0. Add modified files and folders to the staging area
0. When the staging area contains a meaningful set of files, commit them
0. Repeat

##### Team workflow:
0. (Assumes a repository exists on github)
0. Clone to pull new work 
0. Use the local workflow to create a meaningful change (set of commits)
0. Pull to receive new updates to the project.
0. Resolve any conflicts between your work and the team's work.
0. Conflicts are automatically merged if two files do not have changes on the same line.
0. Conflicts with code on the same line must be handled manually.
0. Push to send new work back to github

#####A GUI browser for github:
Git GUI for [Mac](http://mac.github.com/)

Git GUI for [Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

Better git GUI - Atlassian SourceTree

#####A great resource for understanding Github
[Git for Grown Ups](http://24ways.org/2013/git-for-grownups/)

#####Using github considerations:
- Balance

- Isolation & Safety vs Sharing with the team

- Risk - Trying things and playing vs Reliability

####Git Arguments:
Finding help on Git:  **git help**

Git Status:   **git status**

Ask git for help on a particular sub command for example: git help status

Never put a repository in a repository.

A helpful diagram for thinking about Git is:

* shell or local changes
* staging area
* repository
*to share the work, push it to the Github repository (origin)

If we are building off existing work, we often start by cloning the repository


**git clone**   To clone a git repository


The smallest change creates a working copy of the file in shell.  When you have finished with the changes, add the files to the repository.


**git add**     Adds a files with changes to the staging area

A commit collects the files that have been added.  A commit is meaningful piece of work

**git commit -m** Commits the changes to the repository

After you have committed the changes to your local branch, if you want to push your commits to Github use:

**git push**

To pull updated files from Github into an existing repository:

**git pull**

Besides the online videos, a useful git resource is the Git Pro pdf which can be found here:

####Generating Secure Encryption Keys:
Web encryption happens by exchanging keys which Github requires
**SSH**    - Secure Shell
**HTTPS** - HTTP Secure

In order to use the encryption you have to generate the secure shell keys.  Here is the page:
