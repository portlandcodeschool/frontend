#### Google Community
As part of something new, we are establishing a Google+ "Community" just for Portland Code School. We'd appreciate your participation to see if this is something worthwhile. Unlike facebook, Google+ is used by technology professionals to network.

#### Realtime video & desktop sharing: Hangouts, Skype
* Google+ Hangouts - Multiway video and desktop sharing
* Skype - 1 on 1 video and desktop sharing.

There's aren't any regularly scheduled hangouts, yet, so contact the person you want to connect with ahead of time.

#### Realtime chat: IRC
Many developers and all sorts of other people hang out on IRC. It's great for semi-anonymous, real-time communication. It's really a developer's paradise.

There are several command-line clients worth investigating. On the Mac, [Colloqy](http://colloquy.info) is a good choice while [Adium](https://adium.im) is a great multi-modal chat client.

Portland Code School has a student channel on irc.freenode.net called "#portlandcodeschool" that you should check out. Instructors and former students also hangout there.


Like any group or society, IRC has its own norms of interaction. As with any communication situation, it's worth your time to learn how to behave "when in Rome." For an introduction on IRC, see http://www.ircbeginner.com
